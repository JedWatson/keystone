[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/keystonejs/keystone.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/keystonejs/keystone)

[KeystoneJS](http://keystonejs.com) is a powerful Node.js content management system and web app framework built on [express](http://expressjs.com) and [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com). Keystone makes it easy to create sophisticated web sites and apps, and comes with a beautiful auto-generated Admin UI.

Check out [keystonejs.com](http://keystonejs.com) for more info and guides. There you can read the [documentation](http://keystonejs.com/docs) and look at some [example projects](http://keystonejs.com/examples) to understand how to use Keystone. There is also a demo website at [demo.keystonejs.com](http://demo.keystonejs.com/) where you can play around with the Admin UI.

##### Keystone 4.0 Beta Released!

We've been working on a major update to KeystoneJS for the last year, and it's a complete rebuild of Keystone's Admin UI and internal architecture. We'll be publishing a summary of the new features, changes and improvements as we get closer to the final release. In the meantime, see the [changelog](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/blob/master/HISTORY.md) for more details, see the [v3 -> v4 upgrade guide](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/blob/master/docs/guides/v0.3-to-v4.0-Upgrade-Guide.md) and check out the [demo site](http://demo.keystonejs.com/). 


## Installing
First, install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and  [mongodb](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) on your computer.
The easiest way to install Keystone is to use the Yeoman generator. The generator will create a new project based on the options you select and install the required packages from npm:

```
npm install -g yo generator-keystone
yo keystone
```


Alternatively, to install Keystone without a generator, do:
```
npm install --save keystone
```

See the [example projects](http://keystonejs.com/examples) to get up and running.

## Running
To run Keystone after install, make sure you have started mongoDB, and then do:
```
node keystone.js
```
Keystone will now run locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and is ready to use.

## Deploying

When you deploy your KeystoneJS app to production, be sure to set your `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `production`. This enables optimizations and certain features, including template caching, simpler error reporting and HTML minification.

You can do this by setting `NODE_ENV=production` in your `.env` file, which gets handled by [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv). Or you can set it in the shell:

```
NODE_ENV=production node keystone.js
```

There is also a starter project for deploying to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for free to try out:

## About

Keystone gives you:
*	A simple way to create a dynamic web site or app with well-structured routes, templates and models
*	A beautiful Admin UI based on the database models you define
*	Enhanced `models` with additional field types and functionality, building on those natively supported by Mongoose
*	Out of the box session management and authentication
*	An updates framework for managing data updates or initialisation
*	Integration with Cloudinary for image uploading, storage and resizing
*	Integration with Mandrill for sending emails easily
*	Integration with Google Places for clever location fields
*	Integration with Embedly for powerful video and rich media embedding tools

... plus a lot of other tools and utilities to make creating complex web apps easier.

## Database field types

Keystone builds on the basic data types provided by MongoDB and allows you to easily add rich, functional fields to your application's models.

You get helper methods on your models for dealing with each field type easily (such as formatting a date or number, resizing an image, getting an array of the available options for a select field, or using Google's Places API to improve addresses) as well as a beautiful, responsive admin UI to edit your data with.

See the [KeystoneJS database documentation](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database) for details and examples of the various field types, as well as how to set up and use database models in your application.

Keystone's field types include:

*	[Boolean](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-boolean)
*	[Code](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-code)
*	[Color](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-color)

Keystone also has [Relationship fields](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database#relationships) for managing one-to-many and many-to-many relationships between different models.

## Testing
To run the test suite run `npm test`.


### Linking Keystone for Development and Testing

If you want to test or develop against the `master` branch of KeystoneJS (or against your own branch), rather than a published version on **npm**, you just need to check it out then use `npm link` to link it to your project. On Mac OS, this is done like this:

*	Clone KeystoneJS locally, e.g. to `~/Development/KeystoneJS`
*	From the KeystoneJS directory, run `sudo npm link` (you will need to enter your system password)
*	From your project directory, e.g. `~/Development/MySite` (the one with your `package.json` file in it) run `npm link keystone`. This will create a link between `~/Development/MySite/node_modules/keystone` and `~/Development/KeystoneJS`.

Then `require('keystone')` normally in your app - the development copy will be used. Note that running `npm update` will ignore new versions of keystone that have been published.

To go back to using a published version of KeystoneJS from npm, from your project directory, run `npm unlink keystone` then `npm install`.
